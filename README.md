To significantly improve our business operations, we're focusing on leveraging data to optimize sales and inventory. Our primary goals are:

Accurate Sales Forecasting: Predicting future sales trends to enable proactive decision-making and strategic planning.

Cost-Effective Inventory Management: Ensuring we have the right products in the right place at the right time, thereby reducing unnecessary storage expenses and rental costs.

Streamlined Logistics: Optimizing the flow of goods from warehouses to stores to minimize replenishment frequency and overall transportation expenditures.

Business Model Optimization: Identifying and understanding the core factors that drive sales to continuously refine and improve our operational strategies.

Our Machine Learning and Deep Learning Exploration

We conducted a comprehensive comparison of various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to achieve these objectives. Our ML models included Linear Regression and the highly effective XGBoost. In the DL realm, we explored CNNs (ideal for time series), LSTMs (designed to overcome RNN limitations), a powerful CNN+LSTM combination (for feature extraction and prediction), GRUs (known for efficiency), and Transformers (employing self-attention for complex data patterns).

Key Findings: XGBoost and CNN+LSTM Lead the Way

Our findings demonstrate that XGBoost from the ML family and CNN+LSTM from the DL family are the most accurate models for this project.

XGBoost's strengths include:

Generating strong forecasts with minimal setup.
Operating efficiently with less data and fewer features.
Its built-in regularization which actively prevents overfitting, leading to more generalized and reliable predictions.
Its ability to leverage parallel processing for faster execution.
CNN+LSTM's advantages lie in its architecture:

Convolutional layers automatically learn salient features from the input data.
Pooling layers condense information, reducing complexity while retaining crucial insights.
The flattening layer prepares these learned features for seamless integration into subsequent layers.
Fully connected layers then combine these features for robust and accurate predictions.
